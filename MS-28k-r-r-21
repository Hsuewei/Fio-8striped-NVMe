# Use 8 stripe but 8 thread 
# Use "filname=/dev/md0"
# Under the mount point(/opt/fio/t0), there are 8 100g files that generated by round 19
# more warm-up time
# See log, I got around 272K in IOPS.
# Please compared with round 19, two round's numbers are pretty close
#    CONCLUSION:
#	with FIO files generated by "directory=???, size=???, numjobs=???"
#       Using filename=??? or directory=???, the results are almost the same	
# See round 22 that i run fio using "filenname=/dev/md0" after deleting all fio files generated by round 19
